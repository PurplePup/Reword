I've finally had enough time to update my word find letter jumbling game, Reword to version 0.6

Improvements:
- Updated dictionaries to support 6, 7 and 8 letter longest (re-word) words
- Ability to switch dictionaries within the options screen (UK and US included)
- New 'Arcade' game mode that allows progress without requiring a longest word
- Save game feature for returning to a part-played game
- Some animation and design improvements

Known bugs (to be fixed):
- sound (fx) button sometimes gets reversed
- have seen touch offset move though corrected with a game restart
- may not count found words on first level but score increases

Hope it's an improvement
Cheers

This is a clone of a great Flash game called TextTwist I found on the Net a while ago.

Updates:
Now includes GP2X F200 Touchscreen support - many thanks to Micah Stetson (v0.5)
Also includes two new game modes: Speed6 and TimeTrial (v0.4)

The basic idea is, you have a 6 letter word that has been jumbled up and you must find as many of the 3, 4 5 and 6 letter words that can be made from it in the time allowed. You must get at least one 6 letter word to progress to the next level.

The dictionary I am using is a British word list I found (sorry can't remember where, but if I do I'll include a credit) that seems to hold a reasonable selection, which once filtered for just 3-6 letter words contains about 7500 words. The word list can be replaced or amended, and uses an additional utility I wrote that formats the list ready for the game.

Any feedback or suggestions welcome.






Well, I've just submitted my latest update to Reword (v0.5) so hopefully it should show up on the archive in the next 24 hours. [url=http://archive.gp2x.de/cgi-bin/cfiles.cgi?0,0,0,0,25,1867]Reword link[/url]

This update mainly addresses touchscreen support for the F200, and the sound (MOD music) volume problem previously reported.

Menus and in-game play now fully support touchscreen, with single and double tap operation. Double tap menu items to select, single tap letters and the new icon controls in-game to move/select letters or word definitions. 
See the readme.txt for more information.

I don't have a F200 so Micah Stetson pointed me in the right direction with some code changes I could build on, and testing was done through mouse support on the PC and passing the binary to Micah for approval. Hopefully I haven't broken it in this final build.

Anyway, hope it works on the F200, and you like it.
Cheers.
